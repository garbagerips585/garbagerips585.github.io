# Garbage Rips 585 — brand hub site

Content hub + SEO home for Garbage Rips 585, a Pokemon card pack-ripping
channel from Rochester, NY (owner: Tim). Not an ecommerce site — the job is
brand entity SEO and funneling visitors to the channel and socials.

## How the feeds work (no API keys)
YouTube auto-playlists derived from the channel ID:
- All uploads: UUnpEGJ2G_0af1YRyW2euIZQ
- Shorts only: UUSHnpEGJ2G_0af1YRyW2euIZQ
- Long-form only: UULFnpEGJ2G_0af1YRyW2euIZQ
Embedded via /embed/videoseries?list=... so they self-update.
RSS is also available: youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC...

## Layout
```
public/        deployed static root (index, videos, playlists, assets/, data/)
assets-source/ the stylesheet source and the pack art originals, not deployed
scripts/       sync-youtube.mjs, local only, needs YT_API_KEY in the environment
shared/        taxonomy.mjs, the set/product tag rules, imported by both
```

## The stylesheet: edit assets-source/ui.css

**`public/assets/ui.css` is GENERATED. Edit `assets-source/ui.css`, then run
`node scripts/build-css.mjs`.** The generated copy says so in its first line.

The build strips the comments and nothing else: same rules, same order, byte
for byte identical once whitespace and comments are removed. It exists because
the stylesheet is render blocking on all 426 pages and 40% of it was prose.
Measured, gzipped, which is how the host serves it: 42.4KB -> 17.4KB, a 59%
cut to the transfer of the one asset that delays first paint everywhere.

The comments are the point of the source file, so they are not a cleanup
target: most of them record a measurement or a bug that a tidy-up would
otherwise reintroduce. They cost nothing now, so write more of them.

`build-css.mjs` runs FIRST in build-all.mjs, before any page builder, because
shared/chrome.mjs hashes the built stylesheet at import time to make the
`?v=` cache buster. `stamp-assets.mjs` still runs LAST. check-build.py fails
if the two files have drifted apart, which is what catches an edit made to the
generated copy by habit.

Do NOT delete rules because coverage says they are unused. Only 6-15% of the
file is used on any one page, but coverage cannot see :hover, :focus, print,
media query or JS-toggled-class rules, and deleting those is how this site
breaks silently.
Host is GitHub Pages: .github/workflows/pages.yml uploads public/ on every
push to main. There is no server build step. See DEPLOY.md.

## Every click stays on the site
Video tiles everywhere link to that video's own page under `public/rip/`,
never to youtube.com. The embed lives on that page. The only deliberate
outbound links are Subscribe and the social icons.

`scripts/build-pages.mjs` generates a page for EVERY video, so no tile
can dead-end. Videos missing a set or product tag get `noindex` and stay out
of the sitemap, because they would be thin pages; tag them and re-run to
promote them. `shared/paths.mjs` owns the URL shape and the sync stamps
`path` onto every video, so the browser, the generator and the RSS function
cannot drift apart.

## The pack wrapper
The player on every rip page sits under a sealed booster pack that has to be
ripped open. This is not just decoration: YouTube's poster frame is usually
the pulled card, so the thumbnail spoils the video before you press play.

Built from two `.pack-face` halves, each holding a full copy of the pack art
and clipped with a jagged `clip-path` so together they read as one sealed
pack. Click mounts the iframe immediately, then runs shake (0.26s) and tear
(0.62s) over the top of the already-playing video.
The sequence is driven by `animationend`, not by timers matching the CSS
durations, because background tabs clamp `setTimeout` and would desync the
reveal from the tear. Generous fallback timers cover the case where the
animation never fires. `prefers-reduced-motion` skips straight to the video.

The five `@keyframes` (packShake, packFade, tearL, tearR, packFlash) live in
ui.css. They were referenced by name for a long time without existing, which
is silent: a CSS animation naming missing keyframes never runs and never
fires `animationend`, so the pack simply sat there. If the pack stops moving,
check the keyframes are still present before anything else.

**The embed starts MUTED and unmutes itself a moment later. The ORDER is the
whole trick.** A muted media element is exempt from the user-gesture check; an
unmuted one is not, and a cross-origin iframe created during a click does not
reliably inherit that click (Chrome and Firefox usually honour an ancestor's
gesture through `allow="autoplay"`, WebKit does not). That is why this was
intermittent rather than broken: it varied by browser and by visit, never by
video or by page.

The trap that caused the reported bug: unmuting BEFORE playback begins throws
away the exemption `mute=1` just bought, so the player makes its autoplay
attempt as an unmuted element, is refused, and paints YouTube's own play
button. Asking for sound too eagerly causes the exact symptom it was meant to
fix. So:

1. Mount muted. Muted autoplay is never refused, so the rip always starts.
2. Wait for the player to REPORT playing (state 1).
3. Only then unmute. Sound arrives while the pack is still tearing.
4. If unmuting stops it, re-mute, resume, and show `#soundOn` for one tap.

Three things that are easy to get wrong and were all wrong once:
- `onStateChange` delivers `info` as a NUMBER, `infoDelivery` as an object.
  Handling only the object shape silently ignores every state change.
- The `listening` handshake must be REPEATED. The player installs its message
  handler well after the iframe's `load` event and drops anything earlier, so
  sending it once on `load` loses the feed and every decision is made blind.
- Never call `playVideo` on an unmuted, not-yet-started player: a refused
  scripted play is itself what triggers YouTube's play button.

## Set pages
`/sets/<id>.html` is a "Set 101" guide per card set, plus a `/sets/` index.
Two scripts, run in order:

    node scripts/sync-sets.mjs        pulls card data -> public/data/sets.json
    node scripts/build-set-pages.mjs  writes public/sets/

Data is the free Pokemon TCG API (api.pokemontcg.io). It rate-limits hard and
answers 500/502 rather than 429, which reads as missing data until you retry;
sync-sets.mjs backs off and caches raw responses under .cache/ (gitignored).
A cold run takes several minutes, re-runs are instant.

Two constraints that shape these pages:
- The four newest sets (Pitch Black, Chaos Rising, Perfect Order, Ascended
  Heroes) have card lists but NO market prices yet. Pages say so rather than
  render zeros. It resolves itself as the market settles.
- "Still in print" and pack prices are not in the API and are not guessed.
  They live in `data/set-notes.json` for a human, along with any fun facts,
  and are omitted when blank. Everything else is API fact or checklist
  arithmetic. Never state pull rates: we do not have them.

## Video data
- `public/data/videos.json` is the whole catalogue, `playlists.json` the
  playlists. Both are written by `scripts/sync-youtube.mjs`.
- Tags (card set, product type, pull grade) are derived from title plus
  description by `shared/taxonomy.mjs`. Coverage is roughly 90% when the
  description is available, about 50% from titles alone. Hand corrections go
  in `data/overrides.json` and always win.
- No live feed layer. /api/latest was a Cloudflare Function proxying the
  YouTube RSS feed (the feed sends no CORS headers, so the browser cannot read
  it directly). GitHub Pages cannot execute a function, so that fetch was a
  guaranteed 404 on every grid page and both it and functions/ are deleted.
  Freshness comes from the nightly refresh workflow instead.

## Video display rules (these were measured, do not "fix" them)
- Thumbnails come from `i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/<id>/oardefault.webp`, falling
  back to `oardefault.jpg` then `maxresdefault.jpg`. "oar" is the only
  variant at the video's true vertical shape; hqdefault and maxresdefault are
  4:3 and 16:9 crops that letterbox a Short.
- Grid tiles are **2:3**, not 9:16. YouTube, Instagram and TikTok all crop
  vertical video for grids; a true 9:16 tile is 1.78x tall and turns the page
  into a wall of skinny rectangles. The player opens to 9:16 on click so
  playback has no bars.
- Columns: 6 / 4 / 3 / 2, matching YouTube's own Shorts grid.
- Never put live iframes in a grid. One player is ~540KB, so the grid is a
  click-to-load facade and only one player is ever live at a time.
- `modestbranding` is deprecated and does nothing. `rel=0` still scopes end
  screens to this channel.
- All but one video is vertical. The exception is `kj7532tb0_I`. Counts are
  deliberately not written here: they were, and they went stale. Run
  `node scripts/build-untagged.mjs` for the current ones.

## Current state
Homepage order: nav, Greatest Hits (the Hall of Fame card, then a carousel),
Latest rips (carousel), Most wanted, Card Pokedex, Card guides and tools, the
585 hometown band, footer.

**This section described a different page until 14 August 2026 and was
believed.** It listed a ROC ticker, a Rochester skyline SVG, an "Anatomy of a
Rip" plate diagram, a socials-as-diner-menu band and a GMAX card that flipped
to a rainbow rare with a 3D tilt. None of them exist. The Gotchas below still
carried "the ticker and card tilt must stay disabled under
prefers-reduced-motion; card flip stays enabled", which is an instruction about
three elements that are not on the page. A QA agent driving the real page found
nothing to test and said so, which is the only reason it was caught.

If you change the home page, change this paragraph in the same commit. Stale
architecture notes are worse than none: they get quoted back as constraints.

WHAT THE HOME PAGE ACTUALLY DOES NOW, and what not to break:
- Every video band plays IN PLACE. Clicking a pack mounts the player over the
  tile, runs the rip animation and plays there. It does not navigate. This was
  an explicit request and it is easy to undo by accident, because the tile is
  still an `<a>` to the rip page and the handler is what stops it.
- Each tile's rip animation uses THAT VIDEO'S OWN pack art, not the generic
  wrapper. `packSet` in build-proto.mjs picks it.
- Bands other than Greatest Hits are one video at a time with slide buttons,
  not grids. The counter reads "1 / 5".
- The Hall of Fame card keeps its text when the player mounts: the handler
  swaps only the art box, because replacing the whole card lost the title, the
  set and the view count.

The banner art is the header, not a mid-page strip. Do not overlay copy on
it: Trubbish sits dead centre in the source image, so any scrim wide enough
to make text legible washes him out, and any panel large enough hides him.
The copy goes underneath.

Also at root: favicon.ico / favicon-32.png / apple-touch-icon.png (all
cropped from Trubbish's face in logo-square.jpg), robots.txt, sitemap.xml.
assets/og-image.jpg is a 1200x630 crop of banner-trubbish.jpg, wired up as
og:image and twitter:image. Absolute URLs come from `shared/site.mjs`, which
switches on one flag: `LIVE` is still false, so every canonical, og:url and
sitemap entry points at garbagerips585.github.io. Flip `LIVE` and rebuild to
move the whole site onto the real domain in one step. Do not hand-edit URLs.

## Local preview
`node .claude/server.js` (port 4585), or the "grips" entry in the parent
Codex .claude/launch.json. .claude/ is gitignored, so it never deploys.

## Deploy
Git repo, main branch, pushed to garbagerips585/garbagerips585.github.io.
`pages.yml` publishes public/ on every push. Going live is one flag: set LIVE
in shared/site.mjs and run build-all.mjs, which moves every canonical and the
sitemap onto the real domain and generates public/CNAME. Full walkthrough and
the post-flip checks in DEPLOY.md, which also records that the flip has been
rehearsed on a throwaway copy of the tree.

## TODO (rough priority)
1. Greatest Hits playlist. The band ranks by pull tier then views as a
   stand-in; Tim's own playlist would replace it. (The old note here pointed
   at a "HITS ONLY PLAYER" comment in index.html that no longer exists.)
2. Buy garbagerips585.com, set it in Settings > Pages, then verify in
   Google Search Console and submit sitemap.xml. See DEPLOY.md.
3. ~~About page~~ done: /about.html is written, linked and in the sitemap.
4. Blog for actual search traffic: set reviews, pull rates, "Pokemon card
   shops Rochester NY" local angle. Each post embeds a video.
   Add each new page to sitemap.xml.
5. Consider migrating to Astro if the blog grows (keep it static).
6. Naming consistency: "GarbageRips585" (one word, on sticker) vs
   "Garbage Rips 585" (spaced, on YouTube). Tim to pick one for H1/metadata.

## Gotchas
- Shorts playlist embed plays in a normal player, not the Shorts UI.
- prefers-reduced-motion is honoured in three places and all three matter:
  a blanket rule kills every transition and animation, a specific rule stops
  the pack shake and tear so the video is simply revealed, and the tool cards
  only get their hover transform under `no-preference`. This entry used to
  name a ticker, a card tilt and a card flip, none of which exist any more.
  Check the page before writing a rule about it.
- Keep page weight low; images are pre-compressed in assets/.
